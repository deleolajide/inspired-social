BuddyPress Docs adds collaborative work spaces to your BuddyPress community. Part wiki, part document editing, think of these Docs as a BuddyPress version of the Docs service offered by the Big G *ifyouknowwhatimean*

Features include:

* Group-specific Docs
* Doc taxonomy, using tags
* Fully sortable and filterable doc lists
* TinyMCE front-end doc editing
* One-editor-at-a-time prevention against overwrites, plus idle detection/autosave
* Dashboard access and management of Docs for the site admin

<strong>NOTE</strong> This plugin <em>REQUIRES</em> WordPress 3.1 or higher. Lower versions of WP may appear to work, but <em>will</em> compromise the privacy of your Docs.
